Dear Hiring Manager,

I'm applying for the [Role Title] position at [Company Name]. I'm a software engineer with 12 years of experience in embedded software and controls, most recently building precision agriculture systems in modern C++ and Qt on embedded Linux.

In my current role at Ag Leader Technology, I've led development of in-cab touchscreen software including a 3D mapping engine (Qt3D/OpenGL), performance profiling and optimization, and low-level graphics work with custom OpenGL ES shaders. I also build closed-loop control features for precision sprayers, including pressure/flow control and CAN-based integration with third-party nozzle-by-nozzle systems and OEM vehicles over J1939.

I'm particularly interested in [Company Name] because [one sentence about the product/mission/team]. I'd love to bring a mix of hands-on embedded development, systems integration, and practical controls experience to help ship reliable features in real-world equipment.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I'd welcome the chance to discuss how my background fits your needs.

Sincerely,\\
\textcolor{darkgray}{Andrew Gurik}
